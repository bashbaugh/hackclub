# Reverse Workshop: CSS

We're going to learn how to take **any** unstyled HTML, like this:

And make it look pretty using CSS:

This is another reverse workshop: instead of telling you how to make the website above, I'm going to teach you everything you need to style it (and any other website) on your own!

I recommend working in the live editor but the whole project is just an HTML file so you can use the environment you are most comfortable with. To run this meeting show your club the example target project. After that have people open up this page. Most of the workshop will be spent in the editor and on the examples page finding useful code snippets (both linked below). It's okay if people don't make the example target project exactly. It's a source of inspiration not a prescription.

This workshop is all about taking simple ideas and examples and composing them together into more interesting programs.

A few tips:

- As a club leader start out the meeting by demonstrating how to put two code snippets together.
- Encourage people to read each line of the code snippets they are trying to combine. Often they can get themselves "unstuck" just by paying closer attention to details.

## CSS

CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets"! It's a special language used to apply styling - such as fonts, colors, spacing, and more - to HTML. Without CSS, websites wouldn't look very interesting!

CSS works by using "selectors" to target certain elements, such as paragraphs, or images, or buttons, and apply styling rules (called "declarations") to them, such as colors or backgrounds.
